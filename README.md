- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ibeawuchi411
- 👀 DevOps Engineer and AWS Solutions architect with the flair to examine organisations Key Value areas and increase its responsiveness in delivering value.
- 🌱 I have over 5years experience in the use of Linux, git, github and other SDLC tools such as maven and others. I have a wealth of experience in the use of Jenkins (automation tool) and its integration with  other SDLC tools such as git, gitHub,  maven, Nexus, soanrqube, nginx and Tomcat in deploying the CI/CD/CD pipelines.
  With my experience in depolying Java, Nodejs, NET and Python projects over a 5year period I have used Docker to build and containerise applications whilst deploying with Kubernetes.
  In my environment I use Terrraform to provision my infrastructure and configure with Ansible (iac)
  Application Performance monitoring tools such as New Relics, Grafana and Promethus are tools that I use regularly depending on each project.
  My overaching goal is to ensure that the work I deliver achieves cost optimisation, increases performance, the security of each application or architecture is optimised, Fault tolerance is examined in relation to disaster recovery and the limitation of the services available.
